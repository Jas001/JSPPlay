<h1>Welcome to JSPPlay</h1>
<p>There isn't a lot here because this is just a little playground for JSP.</p>
<p>I'm able to create a servlet but haven't really found a good way to do server side code
and separate the html from the event logic.  I'm thinking this is where jsp comes in.  So,
I thought I would give it a try.</p>
<p>The first thing I've done is create just a simple servlet
to make sure everything is working properly and to get warmed up.  I had a little bit of an issue because
I have tomcat installed on my computer and it is actually running.  But, it has been awhile since I've done
Java so I've had the service turned off.  So, this workspace didn't have any servers, so I created a new virtual server pointing
at the tomcat directory.  And, it seems to be working now.  So here it is.</p>

<p>I created a new xml web service and noticed that the location of the servlet mapping is important.  I had the mappings next to eachother
and it didn't work.  So, something new to know.  I'm also aware that Java 5 supports annotations but I'm not interested in that right now.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnUJl3NYRRc">Tutorial I was following.</a>
<p>This is the same XMLServlet but with parameter support added. Also uses a session for the name so if you pass in Name and then pass in blank it will return your name.</p>

<form action="XMLServlet" method="post">
<div style="padding:20px;background-color:#efefef;">
<div>Form using Post Method</div>
Type Name:<input type="text" name="userName"><input type="submit" value="send"/></div>
</form>

<h2>JSP</h2>
<p>I created a jsp page.  This is identical to ASP.</p>

<p>I got a little carried away and wrote a tic tac toe JSP page.  This used a class with unit testing and session variables for the score.</p>
